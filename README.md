# Introduction
###### This project contains everything related to machine learning and deep learning. Its still in development phase but the aim here is to create a scafold to avoid all the redudant code the we need to write while working with a datascience project. The project contains following things -:

**1. Implementations of well known ML algorithms from scratch**
**2. Course materials from coursera.**
**3. Projects.**
**4. Implementation of various evaluation metrics.**
**5. Scafold over visualisation tools such as matplotlib, sns etc**

# Project Description
1. [AQI prediction](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/tree/master/Projects/AQI "AQI prediction")
	 - Predicting AQI of Delhi using data from [tutiempo](https://en.tutiempo.net/ "tutiempo") and PM2.5 data from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/ "openweathermap").
	 - Flow
		 - [Data Collection and Preprocessing](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/blob/master/Projects/AQI/data_collection.py "Data Collection")
		 - [Data Exploration and Model Implementation](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/blob/master/Projects/AQI/AQI%20Prediction.ipynb "Model Implementation")
