# Introduction
###### This project contains everything related to machine learning and deep learning. Its still in development phase but the aim here is to create a scafold to avoid all the redudant code the we need to write while working on a datascience project. The project contains following things -:

- [Implementations of well known ML algorithms from scratch](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/tree/master/algorithms "Implementations of well known ML algorithms from scratch")
- [Course materials from coursera](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/tree/master/coursera_courses "Course materials from coursera")
- [Projects](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/tree/master/Projects "Projects")
- [Implementation of various evaluation metrics](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/blob/master/algorithm_performance/matrics.py "Implementation of various evaluation metrics")
- [Scafold over visualisation tools such as matplotlib, sns etc](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/tree/master/data_visualisation "Scafold over visualisation tools such as matplotlib, sns etc")

# Project Description
1. [AQI prediction](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/tree/master/Projects/AQI "AQI prediction")
	 - Predicting AQI of Delhi using data from [tutiempo](https://en.tutiempo.net/ "tutiempo") and PM2.5 data from [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/ "openweathermap").
	 - Flow
		 - [Data Collection and Preprocessing](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/blob/master/Projects/AQI/data_collection.py "Data Collection")
		 - [Data Exploration and Model Implementation](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/blob/master/Projects/AQI/AQI%20Prediction.ipynb "Model Implementation")

2. [Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Model](https://github.com/vik228/deeplearning_ai/tree/master/Projects/stock-price-prediction-using-lstm "Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Model")
